# awesome-mena-conferences-and-meetups
A list of awesome conferences and meetups in the MENA region. This will hopefully join the [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#readme) (but will also need a markdown version of all conferences and meetups, this could be generated via the JSON files).

For now, this is a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) that will be hosted on a website in the future.
